# BPM Counter

The BPM Counter is a Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to measure the beats per minute (BPM) by pressing a key ('B') and display the result on the screen. It also features the ability to reset the BPM counter using the 'Esc' key and the option to keep the window always on top.

## Features

- Measure and display BPM by pressing the 'B' key.
- Reset the BPM counter by pressing the 'Esc' key.
- Toggle the "Stay on Top" feature to keep the window always visible.
- Drag and move the window by clicking and dragging the main frame.
